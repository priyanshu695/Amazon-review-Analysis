# Amazon-review-Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a technique for examining text data to determine its sentiment. The aim is to automatically recognize and categorize opinions stated in the text to calculate overall emotion. Sentiment analysis techniques categorize them as good, neutral, or negative. Using machine learning and text analytics, algorithms can categorize sentences into positive, negative, and neutral categories. Many companies, including Amazon and Twitter, use this sentiment analysis to analyze customer reviews on their products, and they will improve based on these results.


In this project, we use some amazon reviews analysis using the amazing transformer models such as Vader, RoBERTa, and NLTK.
